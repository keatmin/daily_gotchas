## iterm2 shortcuts

Often times when there are two windows splitted vertically/horizontally in the same profile, one will get more use while others will be in the background.

For example:
```
⌘ + d --> Split window vertically
⌘ + cmd + d --> Split window horizontally

⌘ + shift + enter -->
Maximise the current pane you are working on,
repeat the same command to get the other pane

ctrl + ⌘ + arrow keys --> Resize pane
```
